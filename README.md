### Participant instructions
_Instrumental_  
Someone has told you that you can get free snacks from our vending machine. On the next screen you will see our vending machine. Use the `t` and `v` keys to tilt the machine to the left or right, and try to steal as many snacks as you can! Please only use one finger to press keys.  

_Pavlovian_  
We have discovered that people were stealing from the vending machines! We have upgraded the machine to make them harder to steal from. However, when the machine is overstocked a free snack will fall out. The lights on the front panel indicate whether the machine is overstocked. Watch the lights and learn which snacks fall out. A multiple choice question will test what you have learnt. Use the keyboard [`a` `b` `c` `d`] to indicate the correct answer.  

_Transfer_  
Now you have found one of the upgraded machines. At random intervals we will overstock it with a different snack. You will be given an opportunity to steal from the machine when it is overstocked. However, to test your memory no snacks will appear on the screen. Remember what you have learned, and steal as many snacks as you can.  

_Devaluation_ [before the movie, [click here to download movies](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/Y8qBChvDs3ZS7Qe)]  
Something has happened to one of the snacks. Watch now to see what has happened.  

_Devaluation test_ [shown on screen after the movie]  
You have found one of the original vending machines. As before, you wonâ€™t be shown any snacks on the screen. Use your memory to tilt it for the snack you want.
Try to steal as much as you can, as this will determine what you will get to eat afterwards!
